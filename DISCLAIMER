The Gas Cost Estimator project does not favour or promote any EVM implementation.
And there is no intention to do so in any sense.
In particular, in terms of benchmarks.
Any results or data included in the project do not favour and should not be interpreted as a recommendation towards any EVM implementation.
Note that the final report operates with scaled/relative values rather than absolute measurements results in ms.
The goal is to detect common patterns and relations in an agnostic manner.

EVM implementations picked for the final report included in the project and directly supported by the project
are of an arbitrary choice, without excluding personal preferences.
We believe they are representative of the network and the state of the art.
You are encouraged to integrate with other EVM implementations. 
Feel free to provide necessary changes.

Although, the project may be used to detect areas of potential optimizations
or to track progress between versions etc for a specific EVM implementation.
