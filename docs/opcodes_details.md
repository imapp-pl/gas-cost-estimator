# Rundown of OPCODE details

This file contains a detailed rundown of all EVM OPCODEs concerned, with notes on their specifics and what to watch our for.

Based on `src/program_generator/data/opcodes.csv` and `src/program_generator/data/selection.csv`.

## `0x00,STOP`

`0x00,STOP,0,zero,0,0,Halts execution.,`

- **geth**: does completely nothing
- **evmone**: sets execution state to success and does nothing
- **openethereum**: sets execution state to done and does nothing

can be dropped

## `0x01,ADD` and other binary/ternary arithmetic/logical OPCODEs

The "simple" ones

```
0x01,ADD,3,verylow,2,1,Addition operation,
0x02,MUL,5,low,2,1,Multiplication operation.,

0x1a,BYTE,3,verylow,2,1,Retrieve single byte from word,
```

They pop and push, or pop and peek and then modify stack in-place.

### Parameters

2 or 3 values on the stack, should not have impact on cost.

## `0x0a,EXP`

`0x0a,EXP,(exp == 0) ? 10 : (10 + 10 * (1 + log256(exp))),,2,1,Exponential operation.,"If exponent is 0, gas used is 10. If exponent is greater than 0, gas used is 10 plus 10 times a factor related to how large the log of the exponent is."`

### Parameters

2 values on the stack. Second (`exponent`) will have impact on cost (exponentiation by squaring in all 3 impls).

## `0x30,ADDRESS`

`0x30,ADDRESS,2,base,0,1,Get address of currently executing account.,`

- **geth**: uses `uint256`'s `SetBytes`, but is setting 20 bytes always probably. The addresss is in `callContext.contract.Address()`.
- **evmone**: uses `memcpy` dependant on the address binary size, but the latter is 20 bytes always probably. The address is in `state.msg.destination`.
- **openethereum**: not sure, probably same as others. The address is in `self.params.address.clone()`

### Parameters

Value (non-zeroness) of the address, e.g. `0x0` vs nonzero address? probably not, as zero-address are likely still represented as full 20 bytes in all impls.

So none.

## `0x32,ORIGIN`

`0x32,ORIGIN,2,base,0,1,Get execution origination address.,`

See `ADDRESS`

- **geth**: Data is in `interpreter.evm.Origin.Bytes()`
- **evmone**: Data is in `state.host.get_tx_context().tx_origin` - is getting this always costing the same? **TODO**
- **openethereum**: Data is in `self.params.origin.clone()`

## `0x33,CALLER`

`0x33,CALLER,2,base,0,1,Get caller address.,`

See `ADDRESS`

- **geth**: Data is in `callContext.contract.Caller().Bytes()` - is getting this always costing the same? **TODO**
- **evmone**: Data is in `state.msg.sender`
- **openethereum**: Data is in `self.params.sender.clone()`

## `0x34,CALLVALUE`

`0x34,CALLVALUE,2,base,0,1,Get deposited value by the instruction/transaction responsible for this execution.,`

- **geth**: Data is in `callContext.contract.value`. It is then loaded from BigInt
- **evmone**: Data is in `state.msg.value`
- **openethereum**: Data is in `self.params.value`. It is then unpacked from some special type

### Parameters

Size of the value could have impact (b/c it's loaded from BigInt for `geth` at least)

## `0x35,CALLDATALOAD`

`0x35,CALLDATALOAD,3,verylow,1,1,Get input data of current environment.,`

- **geth**: Data is in `callContext.contract.Input`.
- **evmone**: Data is in `state.msg.input_data`.
- **openethereum**: Data is in `self.params.data`.

### Parameters

Things might depend on `state.msg.input_size` and if the `offset+32` fits into the `input_size`. 
**TODO** does the cost vary if incomplete chunk of data is read?

## `0x36,CALLDATASIZE`

`0x36,CALLDATASIZE,2,base,0,1,Get size of input data in current environment.,`

- **geth**: Data is in `len(callContext.contract.Input)`.
- **evmone**: Data is in `state.msg.input_size`.
- **openethereum**: Data is in `self.params.data.as_ref().map_or(0, |l| l.len())`. Will `None` in `data` have different cost? probably negligible.

## `0x37,CALLDATACOPY`

`0x37,CALLDATACOPY,"2 + 3 * (number of words copied, rounded up)",,3,0,Copy input data in current environment to memory.,2 is paid for the operation plus 3 for each word copied (rounded up).`

- **geth**: Data is in `callContext.contract.Input`. It is copied to a memory spot depending on the offset `callContext.memory.Set(memOffset64...`, so `memory` is also an input
- **evmone**: Data is in `state.msg.input_data` / `state.msg.input_size`. Memory in `state.memory`
- **openethereum**: Data is in `self.params.data`. Memory in `self.mem`

### Parameters

- size of data actually copied (depends on the contents of input and the memory offsets)
- amount of memory allocated
- amount of padding done

## `0x38,CODESIZE`

`0x38,CODESIZE,2,base,0,1,Get size of code running in current environment.,`

- **geth**: Data is in `len(callContext.contract.Code)`
- **evmone**: Data is in `state.code.size()`
- **openethereum**: Data is in `self.reader.len()`

### Parameters

- size of the code?

## `0x39,CODECOPY`

`0x39,CODECOPY,"2 + 3 * (number of words copied, rounded up)",,3,0,Copy code running in current environment to memory.,2 is paid for the operation plus 3 for each word copied (rounded up).`

see `CALLDATACOPY`, everything is same just the data is from the code not input

## `0x3a,GASPRICE`

`0x3a,GASPRICE,2,base,0,1,Get price of gas in current environment.,`

- **geth**: Data is in `interpreter.evm.GasPrice`. It is then loaded from BigInt
- **evmone**: Data is in `state.host.get_tx_context().tx_gas_price` - is getting this always costing the same? **TODO**
- **openethereum**: Data is in `self.params.gas_price.clone()`

### Parameters

Size of the value could have impact (b/c it's loaded from BigInt for `geth` at least)

## `0xfe,INVALID`

`0xfe,INVALID,NA,,NA,NA,Designated invalid instruction.,`

- **geth**: not defined, will short-circuit with `ErrInvalidOpCode` and not be added to the measurements CSV
- **evmone**: sets execution state to invalid instruction and does nothing
- **openethereum**: returns Done with BadInstruction, does nothing.

can be dropped
