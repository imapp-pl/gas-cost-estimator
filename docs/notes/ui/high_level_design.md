# Gas Cost Estimator

> Measuring the true cost of EVM operations across different client implementations

## Main

The project aims to provide a tool for measuring, analysing and comparing gas costs of EVM operations across different implementations. The reproducibility is the key to the research. We have provided a complete setup guide and tooling to make the execution of the benchmarks as easy as possible.

- [Research report](docs/report_stage_iv.md)
- [Gas schedule proposal document](docs/gas-schedule-proposal.md)

The Proposal 

The result of our work is the proposal for the new gas cost schedule. It is based on the results of the analysis of the gas costs of EVM operations. The proposal is a starting point for the discussion and further research.
