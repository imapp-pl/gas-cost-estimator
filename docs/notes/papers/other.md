## Other resources which might be useful

1. Ethereum yellow paper - worth a quick scan, holds an (up-to-date?) list of opcodes in EVM with descriptions and details
2. https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/ - just basics to ramp up with
3. https://www.ethervm.io/ - reference for EVM opcodes + Decompiler
4. https://medium.com/swlh/getting-deep-into-evm-how-ethereum-works-backstage-ab6ad9c0d0bf - nice intro for a broader perspective how EVM works

## Other resources scanned, which aren't relevant to us

1. http://bergel.eu/MyPapers/Soto20a-FuzzingSolidity.pdf - "Fuzzing to Estimate Gas Costs of Ethereum Contracts" - irrelevant; is about comparing Solidity static gas cost estimation and estimation using fuzzing testing.
